Lesson 3 Reflections

Reflect: Using a remote repository

Question:
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
Answer:
  I'd create a remote repository when there will be multiple people/groups working on a single project, so everyone can access the files immediatedly.

Relfect: Manual vs. Automatic Pull

	Question:
		Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Answer: 
		Updating repositories manually is the only way to ensure the information in the files is accurate. An automatic update could possibly update mid-code and potentially cause a catastrophic failure.
