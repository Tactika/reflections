Lesson 3 Reflections
===============================================
Reflect: Using a remote repository

Question:
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
Answer:
  I'd create a remote repository when there will be multiple people/groups working on a single project, so everyone can access the files immediatedly.

Relfect: Manual vs. Automatic Pull

	Question:
		Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Answer: 
		Updating repositories manually is the only way to ensure the information in the files is accurate. An automatic update could possibly update mid-code and potentially cause a catastrophic failure.

Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

	Question: 
		Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Answer: 
		Forks are repositories from other GitHub members, that other users have cloned to their GitHub account... which also gives credit to the original author.
		Clones are copies of repositories, but have no link back to the original author on GitHub.
		Branches are just part of the repositories, which stray from the core code and can possibly merge back to the main branch.
