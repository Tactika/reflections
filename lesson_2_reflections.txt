Reflect: Commit Size

Question: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Answer: Tracking changes is one of the main goals of Git & GitHub. To ensure the changes are tracked correctly and only one logical change is committed, the use of the staging area is important. Only adding the documents/files that are wanted is made easier by using the staging area.
