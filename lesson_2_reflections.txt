Lesson 2 - Reflections
---------------------------------------------------------
Reflect: Commit Size

Question: 
	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Answer: 
	Tracking changes is one of the main goals of Git & GitHub. To ensure the changes are tracked correctly and only one logical change is committed, the use of the staging area is important. Only adding the documents/files that are wanted is made easier by using the staging area.

Reflect: When to Use Branches

Question: 
	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Answer: 
	Branching would be great for a project if it had multiple options or features. It would allow changes to each individual feature, without committing to a complete overhaul of the entire code.
---------------------------------------------------------
Reflect: Visualizing with Diagrams

Question:
	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Answer:
	Diagrams assist in visualizing where you are and what you have access to. You can see where your branches (features) were implimented and other features continued on.

	Reflect: Merging Two Branches

	Question:
		What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	Answer: 
		Merging the branches combines the files, ensuring changes are taken from both merges.

	Reflect: Automatic vs. Manual Merging

	Question:
		What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing the merges manually?

	Answer:
		I would think the pros of manually having to merge items, is that you can ensure the correct data is being merged and any conflicts are resolved.
